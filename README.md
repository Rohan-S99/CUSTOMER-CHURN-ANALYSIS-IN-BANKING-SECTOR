This research project aims to analyze and address customer churn in the banking industry by 
identifying the key predictors influencing churn using predictive analytics model. The database 
contains detailed information about 10,000 bank customers, including their financial health and 
personal information. The survey examines borrowing costs, demographics, bank balances, 
infrastructure, and other relevant factors. Key research questions focus on the likelihood of 
customer convergence, predicting the impact of future trends, proposing strategies to reduce 
customer retention, and identifying the costs of building customer availability emphasis on 
preserving existing ones rather than acquiring new ones. 
Predictive analytics models including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and 
neural networks will be used to predict customer churn The model includes customer data such 
as credit score, age, spending, product role, credit card ownership, level of activity, and salary 
expectations. Significance analysis of these predictive models should be used to determine 
which predictors have the greatest impact on churn. Machine learning models will rank the 
features based on their contribution to the predictive power of the model. The ultimate objective 
of this research is to improve client relationships, engagement tactics, and fundamental 
performance of banks while reducing acquisition costs.

Customer churn in banking applies to the occurrence in which a bank has lost customers for a 
variety of reasons. This can occur for a variety of causes, including unhappiness with the bank's 
services, better offers or services from rivals, changes in client requirements or financial 
conditions, or a general degradation in the bank's brand impression. Because recruiting new 
clients is often more expensive than maintaining current ones, churn may have a major impact 
on a bank's income and market share. Furthermore, high turnover rates can have a negative 
influence on a bank's reputation and client loyalty, making it critical for banks to recognize and 
address the root causes of churn in order to retain a stable and pleased customer base.
PROBLEM STATEMENT￾The banking industry is grappling with a fundamental challenge—customer inflow, where 
customers terminate their ties with banks for a variety of reasons. This report addresses this 
issue by probing key research questions aimed at understanding, predicting and reducing 
customer visits. The following questions guide our research-
1. Find the chances of whether a customer will churn or not: -
How can we know how likely it is that customers will actually come on board? This 
report focuses on developing predictive models to identify and measure customers at 
risk of leaving the bank.
2. Find predictors which are influencing customer churn: -
What are the factors that most affect customers’ access to the banking industry? We 
aim to report a range of forecasts, including financial health, demographics and banking 
behavior, that play an important role in customer churn.
3. What can be done to avoid customer churn? -
What strategies can be implemented to restrict customer flow? This report delves into 
the root causes of churn and offers effective strategies to increase customer satisfaction 
and loyalty.
4. How to retain existing customers as getting new customers have more cost 
associated with compared to retaining the existing customers: -
Considering that acquiring new customers is often costly, how can we strategically 
retain existing customers? Our research analyses the financial implications of retaining 
current customers and formulates strategies for developing optimal products for long term customer relationships.

Through comprehensive research and detailed analysis of customer data, this report aims to 
empower the banking industry to proactively manage customer relationships, improve 
retention efforts, and establish customers churn impact on efficiency. The findings presented 
here provide valuable insights for developing targeted strategies to manage customer inflows, 
ultimately contributing to the continued success of banks.
